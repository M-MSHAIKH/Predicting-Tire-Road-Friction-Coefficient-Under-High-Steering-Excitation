# Predicting Tire-Road Friction Coefficient Under High Steering Excitation
The tire friction coefficient plays a crucial role in determining a vehicle's ability to maneuver. In most driving situations, the friction forces between the tires and the road contribute significantly to the net forces acting on the vehicle, thereby influencing both its lateral and longitudinal movements. Consequently, it is vital for drivers, driver assistance systems, or autonomous vehicles to accurately estimate the friction coefficient that governs the interaction between the tires and the roadway. ([1,2])

This project focuses on predicting the tire-road friction coefficient, i.e. $\mu$ for a stationary vehicle under high steering excitation conditions using deep learning models, i.e. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The models are trained with labeled (True) values of the friction coefficient (Î¼) obtained from a physical tire brush model, utilizing mean values to represent tire-road interactions accurately. The previous research on the tire brush models indicates that the physical model, i.e. tire brush model failed to estimate the tire road friction coefficient as a constant during high steering excitation.

Further, for simplicity the model predict the $\mu$ of only front tires. By capturing the temporal dependencies in the data, this approach enhances the prediction of the friction coefficient for stationary vehicles, contributing to better tire-road interaction models for various applications in vehicle dynamics and stability analysis.

    - Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 16.9859

- **GRU accuracy**:
    - Root Mean Square Error : 0.1579

## Result

-   The LSTM model outperformed the GRU model in terms of both RMSE and MAPE, indicating better overall accuracy and reliability in predicting the coefficient of friction under the given conditions.

-   The GRU model's higher error rates and increased variability in predictions suggest it may be less suitable for this specific task compared to the LSTM model.

-    LSTM model, Exhibited overlapping predictions for different surfaces, particularly between dry and wet surfaces, and ice and ice sheet surfaces. This overlap makes surface classification more challenging with the LSTM model.
